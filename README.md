# boston-house-price-predction
The problem that we are going to solve here is that given a set of features that describe a house in Boston, our machine learning model must predict the house price. To train our machine learning model with boston housing data, we will be using scikit-learnâ€™s boston dataset.  In this dataset, each row describes a boston town or suburb.
Boston House Price Prediction Model
Here we have the Boston house price dataset with around 500 records. so we are going to build a Regression ML Model which can predict the price of the House in that city by studying the given features.

The Phases in building the Model are:

We have to create a Model to predict house Prices in Boston:

This is a regression problem.
we will be using XGBoost Regression for creating the model.
